# Readme-generator
This README generator uses node.js so that a user can answer questions to generate a README.md file. 

## User story
As a user, I want a quick and efficient way to create a README file for any projects that I am working on. 

## Usage
To run this application, type 'node <index.js>' <or the corresponding file name> which will run a number of prompts based on what I want to appear on the README file that will be generated. The prompts consist of: 
- Give your README a file name 
- Project file 
- Project description
- Installation instructions
- Usage
- Lisence (a multiple-choice question)
- Contribute
- Tests
- Whats your GitHub username?
- Whats your email?

Once a user has filled out these prompts, a README file is generated.

## Packages 
For this project I used the npm inquirer package, a collection of common interactive command line user interfaces.

##Â Example
There is an example of a README file that I generated named 'lewis-test.md' in this repository.

There is a corresponding video of me generating this README.
