# Readme-generator
This README generator uses node.js so that a user can answer questions to generate a README.md file. 

## User story
As a user, I want a quick and efficient way to create a README file for any projects that I am working on. 

## Usage
To do this, type 'node <index.js>' <or the corresponding file name> which will run a number of prompts based on what I want to appear on the README file that will be generated. The prompts consist of: 
- Give your README a file name 
- Project file 
- Project description

## What next
At time of writing, I am yet to add lisence badges to the README file.
I have also been unable to add all prompts to the generated README file without errors. 
I will fix the two things above in the next few days.
